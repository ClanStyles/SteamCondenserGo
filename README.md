### What is the goal of this project?

I'm learning Go Lang and need a suitable test project.

### Can you add XXX?

I might, create a ticket.

### What is working?

As of right now, only querying Source Servers (Which GoldSrc now uses)

### What is your motivation for this?

I have another project that needs to query and cache many game servers. Go Lang just seemed like the best language to do it in.
